After 2 years of radio silence and having spend uncountable hours in the studio, Niels finally designed a sound he was proud to say was his, which triggered a comeback under the name we now know as AKAI! AKAI immediately gained traction with the scene again. His '100% MIX' was well received and it even reached the attention of big promoters. Today, only 5 months &amp; 17 days later, 'AKAI' is a common name and has performed at some of the biggest events in Belgium. Also production wise he has been making moves. This didn't remain unnoticed by big labels and led to his bootleg being released at Duttydrops. He has a lot more comming and has a bright future ahead.
